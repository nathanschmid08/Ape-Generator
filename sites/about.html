    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        The Ape Generator is a fun, privacy-friendly tool that answers a surprisingly important question:
        What kind of ape do you look like?
    </p>

    <p>
        Upload a photo of yourself, and the tool will instantly show you your closest ape look-alike — all processed locally, right in your browser. 
        Whether you're here out of curiosity, boredom, or for the laughs, this tool delivers instant entertainment without compromising your privacy.

        Originally created as a lighthearted side project, the Ape Generator mixes humor with privacy-first technology
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Because sometimes, all you need is a digital mirror… held up by a monkey.
