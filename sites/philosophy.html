    <h1>PHILOSOPHY</h1>
    <main>
        <p>
            At its core, the Ape Generator was created with a simple yet powerful principle: enable creativity without compromising privacy. 
            In a digital jungle full of tracking scripts, ads, and cloud dependencies, this tool chooses a different path — a path that’s lightweight, local, and 100% yours.
            Just like real apes, who thrive through adaptation and independence, this project values autonomy and simplicity. 
            All processing happens directly in your browser.

        <p>
            Nothing is uploaded, nothing stored, and no data ever leaves your device. 
            You remain in full control — no accounts, no cookies, no surveillance.
        </p>

        <p>
            We believe that great tools shouldn’t spy on you, slow you down, or stand in your way. 
            The Ape Generator is built to be as nimble and curious as its namesake: playful in nature, but with a clear purpose. 
            Whether you're here to generate something fun or to explore a creative idea, this tool lets you swing freely through your own imagination — no servers attached.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let your inner ape create — wild, free, and completely private.
